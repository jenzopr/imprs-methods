The package `dplyr` provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames. We're going to learn some of the most common dplyr functions: `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()`.

### Prerequisites

First make sure, that `dplyr` loads correctly, otherwise, install the package:

```{r}
if( "dplyr" %in% installed.packages()) {
  library(dplyr)
} else { 
  install.packages("dplyr")
}
```

Now download the species-weight data from the web and load it as `data.frame`:

```{r}
if(!file.exists("data/portal_data_joined.csv")) {
  download.file("http://files.figshare.com/2236372/combined.csv","data/portal_data_joined.csv")
}
data = read.table("data/portal_data_joined.csv",sep = ",", header = T)
```

Remember the following columns of the data:

Column | Description
------ | -----------
record_id |	Unique id for the observation
month |	month of observation
day |	day of observation
year |	year of observation
plot_id |	ID of a particular plot
species_id |	2-letter code
sex |	sex of animal
hindfoot_length |	length of the hindfoot in mm
weight |	weight of the animal in grams
genus |	genus of animal
species |	species of animal
taxa |	e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit
plot_type |	type of plot

#### Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data frame (`data`), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, eval=F}
select(data, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

```{r, echo=F}
head(select(data, plot_id, species_id, weight))
```

To choose rows, use `filter()`:

```{r, eval=F}
filter(data, year == 1995)
```

```{r, echo=F}
head(filter(data, year == 1995))
```

**Hint:** Ouuups, this was a lot of output! Remember to use the `head` function if you expect large output and don't want to write all of it to your screen.

#### Pipes

But what if you wanted to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes. 

+ With the intermediate steps, you essentially create a temporary data frame and use that as input to the next function. This can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects. 
+ You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another). This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested as the process from inside out. 
+ The last option, pipes, are a fairly recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to many things to the same data set.

Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr` package installed as part of `dplyr`.

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above we use the pipe to send the surveys data set first through filter, to keep rows where wgt was less than 5, and then through select to keep the species and sex columns. When the data frame is being passed to the filter() and select() functions through a pipe, we don't need to include it as an argument to these functions anymore.

If we wanted to create a new object with this smaller version of the data we could do so by assigning it a new name:

```{r}
small <- data %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

small
```

Note that the final dataframe is the leftmost part of this expression. If you find that confusing, you can use the `->` operator, which might make it easier to envision the data "flowing" from left to right:

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight) -> small
```

### Challenge

+ Using pipes, subset the data to include rows before 1995. Retain columns `year`, `sex` and `weight`.

#### Mutate data frames

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions or find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we'll use mutate().

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r}
data %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head(., n=20)
```

Using a dot (`.`) inside the `head` call references the current data frame, e.g. the one mutated with a `weight_kg` column.
The first few rows are full of NAs, so if we wanted to remove those we could insert a filter() in this chain:

```{r}
data %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  head
```

Here, head is called without additional parameters, which eliminates the requirements of the brackets `(` and `)`.

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is or is not an `NA`. The `!` symbol negates it, so we're asking for everything that is not an `NA`.

#### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. 

![](images/splitapplycombine.png)

dplyr makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function. `group_by()` splits the data into groups upon which some operations can be run. For example, if we wanted to group by sex and find the number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  tally()
```

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()` which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group. So to view mean weight by sex:

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You can group by multiple columns too:

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Looks like most of these species were never weighed. We could then discard rows where `mean_weight` is `NaN` (NaN refers to *Not a Number*) using `filter()`:

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!is.nan(mean_weight))
```

All of a sudden this isn't running off the screen anymore. That's because dplyr has changed our data.frame to a tbl_df. This is a data structure that's very similar to a data frame; for our purposes the only difference is that it won't automatically show tons of data going off the screen.

You can also summarize multiple variables at the same time:

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            min_weight = min(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!is.nan(mean_weight))
```

### Challenges

+ How many times was each `plot_type` surveyed?
+ Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species.
+ What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`, `genus`, `species`, and `weight`.

### Solutions

+ Using pipes, subset the data to include rows before 1995. Retain columns year, sex and weight.

```{r, eval=F}
data %>%
  filter(year < 1995) %>%
  select(year, sex, weight)
```
+ How many times was each `plot_type` surveyed?

```{r, eval=F}
data %>%
  group_by(plot_type) %>%
  tally
```

+ Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species.

```{r, eval=F}
data %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  mutate(min = min(hindfoot_length, na.rm=T),
                                      max = max(hindfoot_length, na.rm=T),
                                      mean = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm=T))
```

+ What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`, `genus`, `species`, and `weight`.

```{r, eval=F}
data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(max_weight = max(weight, na.rm=T)) %>%
  filter(weight == max_weight) %>%
  select(year, genus, species, weight)
```
