We'll explore ggplots point-geom using the **Theoph** data set build into R.
First, make sure, that all required packages are loaded:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

If you encounter an error, try to install those packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
```

ggplot2 is based on the **grammar of graphics**, the idea that every graph is build from a few components: a **data set**, a set of **geoms** and a **coordinate system**.
Lets load the data we're working with:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
data(Theoph)
```

The basic command that you need is

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p = ggplot(data=Theoph, aes(x=Time, y=conc))
```

**Explanation**: The function ggplot initializes the *empty* plot. With *data*, we tell ggplot, which dataset to use and we already do a **mapping** from **Time to X** and **conc to Y**.

If we try to *see* p, our plot object, that we just created, an empty plot appears:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(p)
```

Since we saved the basic plot as object **p**, we can easily extend it by adding geoms:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p + geom_point()
```

If we want to keep the results we achived so far, we simply save it back:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p1 = p + geom_point()
print(p1)
```

**Hint**: Use the steps *extending* and *saving* to iteratively build up the plot.

Lets first add some color to the points and make them a bit bigger:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p + geom_point(color="blue", size=3)
```

Or lets change the shape of the points:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p + geom_point(color="blue", size=3, shape=2)
```

**Hint**: Here is an overview of all available shapes:

Now back to the data. Could we encode the Dose subjected as color? Sure:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(color=Dose), size=3)
```

What did we do here? We added a new **mapping** from **Dose to color**. 
We could also map **Wt to color**:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(color=Wt), size=3)
```

It seems that heavy subjects show a lower overall concentration than lighter subjects.

Assuming that a concentration below 3 is below the detection limit. It would be nice, to have a horizontal line that marks a concentration of 3.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(color=Wt), size=3) + geom_hline(yintercept = 3)
```

Lets make a new plot of something different:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p2 = ggplot(data=Theoph, aes(x=Wt, y=Dose)) + geom_point(size=3)
p2
```

Oouups! The Dose is highly dependent on the subjects weight! What does this mean to our data?

Since the axis labels are a bit non-telling, lets change them:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
p2 + xlab("Weight in kg") + ylab("Dose in mg/kg")
```

Now, lets visualize all concentrations for each subject:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data=Theoph, aes(x=Subject, y=conc)) + geom_point()
```

But we can't visualize the time course this way!
A better way to visualize per subject response is **faceting**:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p3 = ggplot(data=Theoph, aes(x=Time, y=conc)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Subject, ncol=4)
```

And lets add some statistics, like a fitted line for each subjects response:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p3 + geom_smooth(se=F, color="gray")
```

**Special**

Suppose that a concentration above 9 has severe effects on the subject. Can we mark all measurements in red, that show a concentration above 9?
Yes, but we have to modify the data!

```{r, eval=TRUE}
Theoph2 = Theoph
Theoph2$critical = ifelse(Theoph$conc > 9, TRUE, FALSE)
```

Now plot it again, but this time with **critical mapped to color**:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
p4 = ggplot(data=Theoph2, aes(x=Time, y=conc)) + geom_point(aes(color=critical)) + facet_wrap(~Subject, ncol=4) + geom_smooth(se=F, color="gray")
```

If we don't like the colors, we can manually specify them:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p4 + scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "red"))
```

And as a last step, lets remove the labels for critical, since we have to explain it anyway in the figure caption:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
p4 + scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "red")) + guides(color=FALSE)
```
